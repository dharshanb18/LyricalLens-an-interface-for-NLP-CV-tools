# LyricalLens-an-interface-for-NLP-CV-tools
This interface combines Computer vision and Natural Language processing for the tools there which are 1)Image to poem 2)Image to story 3)Virtual mouse 4)Ocr analysis


For image to poem nd image to story there are two ways,
1) use a LLM api key with the extracted keywords.
2) Train a model (NLP model) with data sets available (we have trained a few but it requires GPU resource and a proper transformer based architecture (lstm or sequential prediction might not work).
